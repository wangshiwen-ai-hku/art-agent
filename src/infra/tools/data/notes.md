## Logo Design - Abstract Tiger H

**Initial Concept:**
*   Abstract H letter combined with tiger form.
*   H strokes form tiger body/tail, dynamic forward pose.
*   Style: Minimalist vector logo, flat icon, orange & black.

**Generated Image:**
*   Preview image generated based on prompt.

**Reflection & Improvement:**
*   **Issue:** Tiger overlaid on H, not integrated. H strokes don't form tiger.
*   **Improved Prompt:** Seamless integration of H strokes into tiger form (legs, body, tail). Must read as both H and tiger in motion. Flat icon, orange/black.
*   **Scores:**
    *   Consistency: 2 (Poor integration)
    *   Creativity: 4 (Unrealized potential)
    *   Aesthetics: 5 (Clumsy overlay)
    *   Simplicity: 8 (Clean, minimalist)
    *   Usability: 9 (Scalable vector)
*   **Recommendation:** Focus on making H strokes integral to tiger form.
*   **Next Step:** ComposeExisting notes:

New notes:

*   **AI Reflection:** Generated images still fail to integrate H and tiger; tiger is layered on H, not formed by H strokes. Lacks cleverness and unity.
*   **Improved Design Prompt:** Minimalist logo of a tiger forming the letter 'H'. Tiger's legs form vertical strokes, torso forms horizontal crossbar. Must clearly read as both tiger (leaping) and 'H'. Simple, flat, two-color (orange/black) vector icon on white. No layering.
*   **Reflection Dimensions:**
    *   Consistency: 2 (Core instruction not met; tiger separate from H)
    *   Creativity: 4 (Potential unrealized; simple combination, not clever integration)
    *   Aesthetics: 4 (Clumsy, forced; separation prevents unity)
    *   Simplicity: 7 (Minimalist style, but failed integration complicates)
    *   Usability: 9 (Vector, simple colors ensure scalability)
*   **Overall Score:** 5.2
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Avoid layering tiger on H.
    *   Explicitly define which tiger parts form H strokes for true integration.
