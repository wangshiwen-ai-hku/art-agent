## Psycho App Logo - Iteration 1

*   **Core Element:** Letter "P" with abstract, wave/brain-like extension.
*   **Style:** Minimalist, abstract, clean lines, modern.
*   **Colors:** Deep teal to warm purple gradient.
*   **Concept:** Individuality, inner complexity, support, empowerment.
*   **Issues:** Brain shape not seamlessly integrated, gradient partial, potential scalability issues.
*   **Next Step:** Preview Image.

## Psycho App Logo - Iteration 2 (Improved Prompt)

*   **Refinement:** Abstract contour fully integrated into "P" structure, smooth gradient across entire form.
*   **Goal:** More seamless, elegant, and unified design.
*   **Focus:** Subtle complexity, modern empathy, balance, harmony.
*   **Next Step:** Preview Image.*   **Goal:** More seamless, elegant, and unified design.
*   **Focus:** Subtle complexity, modern empathy, balance, harmony.
*   **Current State:** 'P' integration with brain-like contour and gradient application are not fully seamless or unified. The 'P' is sometimes obscured or the contour appears as an addition rather than integrated.
*   **Next Step:** Compose*   **Issue:** Brain-like contour and gradient not seamlessly integrated into the 'P'. Contour appears separate or added, not unified. Gradient flow is inconsistent.
*   **Next Step:** Compose*   **Issue:** Brain-like contour and gradient not seamlessly integrated into the 'P'. Contour appears separate or added, not unified. Gradient flow is inconsistent.
*   **Next Step:** Compose

*   **Issue:** The 'P' is barely discernible, and the gradient is inconsistently applied. The brain shape appears on top of the 'P'.
*   **Next Step:** Compose

*   **Issue:** Brain-like contour is still a separate element within the 'P', not integrated into its structure. Gradient is not consistently applied across the entire form.
*   **Next Step:** Compose

*   **Issue:** The 'P' and brain-like contour are not a single, unified form. The gradient is not continuous across the entire shape.
*   **Next Step:** Summarise
