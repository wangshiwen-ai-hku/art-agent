# Math Agent Memory & Tool Proficiency Playbook

This file serves as the long-term, persistent memory for the Math Agent. It contains a structured library of tool usage patterns, design reflections, and successful action sequences. The Planner node consults this "playbook" to make more informed, expert-level decisions, moving beyond naive trial-and-error.

## Core Concepts

- **Action-Result Samples:** Each entry documents a specific tool or combination of tools, the context in which they were used, and the outcome.
- **Reflections:** After a successful design, the agent reflects on *why* a particular approach worked, creating generalizable knowledge.
- **Tool-Use Intuition:** By continuously referencing and adding to this playbook, the agent develops a "feel" for how to best use its tools, much like an experienced human designer.
