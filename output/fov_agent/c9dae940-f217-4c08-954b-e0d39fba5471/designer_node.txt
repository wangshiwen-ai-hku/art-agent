logo design, minimalist, vector art, flat icon, black and white, high contrast, centered, isolated on a white background.

A graphic logo based on the concept of "mountains and ravines" using the yin-yang interchange positive and negative space technique.

The entire design is contained within a perfect circle. The circle is split into two perfectly interlocking shapes by a single, dynamic, S-curved line that runs diagonally through the center.

The top-left shape, the positive space, is solid black. It represents a mountain range. Its shared boundary with the white space is a stylized, sharp, jagged line, evoking the silhouette of mountain peaks.

The bottom-right shape, the negative space, is pure white. It represents a deep, winding ravine or canyon. Its shared boundary is the exact same jagged line, which now defines the steep, twisting edge of the ravine.

The black mountain shape and the white ravine shape are mutual and complementary, one cannot exist without the other, sharing the same contour line. Clean, bold, graphic, no grey tones.
