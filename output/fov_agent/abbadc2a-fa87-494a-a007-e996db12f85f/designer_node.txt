Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white, figure-ground reversal, yin-yang. A solid black shape forming a downward-pointing bomb or missile as the positive form. A pure white shape of a flying dove, viewed from the side and ascending upwards, is created in the negative space. The interaction of the boundaries is the central focus: the left contour of the black bomb is a shared, curved line that simultaneously and perfectly creates the right contour of the white dove's body, outlining its chest, belly, and tail. The two shapes are perfectly interlocked and balanced, creating a powerful visual duality where the form of destruction gives birth to the form of peace. The entire design is a single, cohesive graphic, representing the inseparable relationship between war and peace. Isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, clean lines, solid shapes, no text, no gradients or textures, centered.
