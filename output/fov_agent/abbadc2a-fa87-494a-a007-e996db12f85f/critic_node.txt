Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat vector art, strictly black and white. The current image is conceptually incorrect. It must be redesigned to be a true figure-ground reversal, not a white dove layered on top of a bomb. Remove the black circle background and all gradients, shadows, and gray tones. Create a single, solid black shape of a downward-pointing bomb. The key is the shared contour: the left edge of this black bomb must be a perfectly curved line that simultaneously creates the entire right-side silhouette of a pure white dove. This single, shared boundary must define the dove's chest, belly, and tail, making the two forms inseparable. The dove, created from the pure white negative space, should appear to be ascending. The bomb and dove must be perfectly interlocked into one cohesive graphic on a pure white background, embodying the yin-yang principle with clean lines and high contrast.
