Logo design, graphic icon, negative space, figure-ground reversal, minimalist, vector art, flat design, black and white, circular logo. A perfect circle is the main frame, cleanly isolated on a pure white background. The circle is bisected into two perfectly interlocking forms, one black and one white, by a single, complex, shared contour line that flows across the composition. The upper form is solid black, its shape representing a mountain range. Its lower boundary, the shared contour, is a sharp, jagged, and angular line, creating the silhouette of multiple mountain peaks and ridges. The lower form is pure white, its shape representing a deep ravine or canyon. Its upper boundary is the exact same jagged and angular line, which now defines the steep, twisting cliffs and edges of the ravine seen from above. The black mountain silhouette and the white ravine silhouette are perfectly complementary and mirrored, creating a dynamic visual balance where the figure and ground are interchangeable. The design is a single, cohesive shape, high contrast, clean lines, no text, no gradients.
