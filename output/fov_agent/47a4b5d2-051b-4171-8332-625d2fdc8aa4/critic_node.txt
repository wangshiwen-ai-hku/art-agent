Replace the entire image of garbled text. Generate the correct logo: a perfect circle isolated on a pure white background. This circle is cleanly bisected into two parts by a single, complex, jagged line. The upper half is solid black, its lower edge forming the silhouette of a mountain range with sharp peaks. The lower half is pure white, its upper edge being the exact same jagged line, which now represents the edges of a canyon or ravine. The black mountain shape and the white ravine shape must be perfectly interlocking, creating a flawless figure-ground reversal where both elements are equally recognizable. The final design must be a minimalist, high-contrast, flat vector graphic with extremely clean lines, no text, and no gradients.
