Modify the logo so the lowercase letter 'a' is a single, solid black form without any internal black shapes or additional lines. The entire area inside the circular bowl of the 'a' should be a single, contiguous white negative space. This white space itself forms the complete silhouette of a cat. Reshape the inner contour of the letter 'a's bowl so it becomes a shared, continuous line that perfectly outlines the cat: the lower part of this curve forms the cat's arched back and curled-up hind legs. The upper part of the same continuous curve defines the profile of the cat's head, pointed ears, and chest, creating a compact, downward-looking posture. The resulting cat is a pure white silhouette formed exclusively by the negative space, with no internal details.
