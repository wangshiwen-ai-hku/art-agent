A minimalist black and white logo, vector art, high contrast, clean lines, isolated on a white background. Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white. A solid black, stylized lowercase letter 'a' is the positive form. The negative space inside the circular bowl of the 'a' reveals a complete white silhouette of a cat. The interaction of the boundaries is paramount: the inner contour of the 'a's bowl is a shared, continuous line that simultaneously and perfectly outlines the cat's shape. The lower part of this curve forms the cat's gracefully arched back and hind legs. The upper part of the same curve defines the shape of the cat's head, pointed ears, and chest as it looks downwards, creating a compact and cozy posture. The entire design is a single, cohesive, and balanced shape, merging the identity of the letter with the form of the animal. Isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, clean, solid shapes, no gradients or textures.
