A minimalist black and white logo, vector art, high contrast, clean lines, isolated on a white background. Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white. A solid black, bold, uppercase letter 'D' serves as the positive form. The white negative space enclosed within the letter 'D' is expertly sculpted to reveal the negative form: a distinct silhouette of a dog's head in profile. The inner arc of the letter 'D' is the critical shared contour, a single, flowing line that simultaneously defines the boundary of both shapes. This elegant curve perfectly outlines the dog's forehead, slopes down to form its snout and nose, and then curves underneath to define its jaw and neck. The straight, vertical stem of the 'D' creates the clean, straight back of the dog's head. The dog faces left, nestled seamlessly within the letter. The entire design is a single, cohesive, and clever graphic shape, isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, with sharp, clean edges and no gradients or textures.
