Reshape the inner contour of the black letter 'D' so it becomes the definitive profile of the dog's head. This shared boundary must be a single, flowing line that forms the dog's forehead, slopes down to create the snout, and then curves under to define the jawline. The straight, vertical stem of the 'D' must form the clean, straight back of the dog's head and neck. Remove all internal black linework from the dog's head, rendering it as a pure, solid white silhouette defined entirely and exclusively by the edges of the surrounding black shape.
