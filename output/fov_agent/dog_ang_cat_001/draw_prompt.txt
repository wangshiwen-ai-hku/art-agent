Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white. A solid black shape of a dog 
as the positive form (正形). The dog's silhouette, primarily its head and chest, is positioned facing to the right. Within the negative space created by the dog's form, a white silhouette of a cat is revealed as the negative form (负形). The interaction of the boundaries is critical: the inner contour of the dog's chin, neck, and chest area is a shared line, which simultaneously and perfectly creates the outer contour of the cat's head, pointed ears, and curved back. The white cat is nestled snugly under the dog's chin, looking towards the left. The entire design is a single, cohesive shape, representing friendship and care. Isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, clean, solid shapes, no gradients or textures.
