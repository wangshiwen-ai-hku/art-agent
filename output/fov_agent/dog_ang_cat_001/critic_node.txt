`edit_prompt`: Remove the abstract lock-like shape from the negative space of the white cat's body, making the cat a single, solid white silhouette. Simultaneously, remove the isolated white line detail on the black dog's head, ensuring the dog's head is a uniform, solid black shape. The most critical modification is to reshape the shared boundary: the inner contour of the black dog's neck and chest must be completely redrawn to perfectly and simultaneously form the outer contour of the white cat's head, pointed ears, and curved back. The cat should be seamlessly carved out of the dog's form, sharing a single common line, so that the two animals are interlocked in a cohesive and harmonious unit. Remove the swooping S-curve on the right side to create a more compact and balanced overall logo shape.
