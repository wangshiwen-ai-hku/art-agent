A minimalist black and white logo, vector art, high contrast, clean lines, isolated on a white background. Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white. A solid black shape of a military helmet in profile as the positive form. The negative space, created by the helmet's inner boundary, reveals a pure white silhouette of a dove as the negative form. The interaction of the boundaries is seamless: a single, fluid, shared contour line that defines the concave opening of the black helmet simultaneously and perfectly outlines the convex shape of the white dove's breast, neck, and head. The dove is nestled within the helmet's protective curve. The entire design is a single, cohesive graphic shape, isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, clean, bold lines, no gradients or textures.
