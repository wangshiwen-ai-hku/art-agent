Modify the image from a white outline on a black background to a single, solid black shape on a pure white background. This solid black shape is a minimalist military helmet in profile. The human face profile is removed. The negative space created by the helmet's inner boundary forms the complete, pure white silhouette of a dove. The inner edge of the black helmet is a single, fluid, shared contour that simultaneously defines the concave opening of the helmet and the convex shape of the white dove's breast, neck, and head. The dove is a pure white silhouette, without any internal lines for eyes or wings. The final graphic is a high-contrast, flat vector icon composed only of the solid black helmet shape and the white dove formed by its negative space.
