Redraw the entire image to correctly implement the yin-yang concept. The black dove and the white bomb must not be separate icons; they must form a single, unified circle. The top-left half of the circle is a solid black shape that is a complete silhouette of a dove. The bottom-right half is the pure white background, but its shape, defined by the shared S-curve, must form a complete silhouette of a falling missile or bomb, not the separate cartoonish round bomb shown. The S-curve that divides the black and white areas must simultaneously serve as the smooth, curved underbelly of the black dove and the sleek, aerodynamic top edge of the white bomb. The two shapes should be perfectly interlocked and mutually defining within the circular boundary. Eliminate all separate icons and code text from the final image.
