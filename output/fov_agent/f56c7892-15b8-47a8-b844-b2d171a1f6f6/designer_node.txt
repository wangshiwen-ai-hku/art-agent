Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white, yin-yang style, figure-ground reversal. A perfect circle is completely filled, split into two perfectly interlocking shapes by a single, dynamic S-curved line that runs diagonally. The top-left shape is solid black, forming the complete silhouette of a dove, a symbol of peace. The dove's head and beak are elegantly defined, facing upwards and to the left. The bottom-right shape is pure white, forming the complete silhouette of a falling bomb or missile, a symbol of war. Its pointed tip aims downwards and to the right. The shared S-curved boundary is the critical element: this single line simultaneously creates the gentle, curved contour of the dove's underbelly and breast, while also forming the sleek, aerodynamic upper edge of the bomb's casing. The black dove and the white bomb are mutually defining and exist in a state of perfect visual balance, each giving form to the other, creating a powerful duality within one cohesive shape. Isolated on a neutral background, high contrast, clean bold lines, solid shapes, no gradients or textures.
