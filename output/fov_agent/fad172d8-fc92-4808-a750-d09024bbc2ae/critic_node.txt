The white dove is not an element placed inside the black bomb; instead, the white dove is formed entirely by the negative space surrounding the black bomb. The boundary of the black bomb shape is the shared contour that also defines the white dove shape. The sleek, curved sides of the bomb's body flawlessly define the elegant neck, breast, and body of the dove. The upper contour of the black bomb, including its tail fins, simultaneously and precisely forms the lower edge of the white dove's spread wings and fanned-out tail. The sharp, pointed tip of the bomb at the bottom perfectly doubles as the dove's beak and completes its head. The entire composition is a single, cohesive shape where the black bomb is the positive form pointing downwards and the white dove is the negative form flying upwards. The final image uses only solid black and solid white, with all gradients, textures, and other colors removed.
