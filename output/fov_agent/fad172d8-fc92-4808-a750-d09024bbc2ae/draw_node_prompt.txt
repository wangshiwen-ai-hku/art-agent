A minimalist black and white logo, vector art, high contrast, clean lines, isolated on a white background. Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white. A solid black shape representing war, a bomb, as the positive form (正形), is oriented vertically and points downwards. Within the surrounding white space, a silhouette of a dove, representing peace, is revealed as the negative form (负形), oriented vertically and flying upwards. The interaction of the boundaries is critical and seamless: the upper contour of the black bomb, including its tail fins, simultaneously and precisely forms the lower edge of the white dove's spread wings and fanned-out tail. The sleek, curved sides of the bomb's body flawlessly define the elegant neck, breast, and body of the dove. The sharp, pointed tip of the bomb at the bottom perfectly doubles as the dove's beak and completes its head. The black bomb and the white dove are two complete, instantly recognizable images that share the same contours, creating a powerful figure-ground reversal. The entire design is a single, cohesive shape. Isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, clean, solid shapes, no gradients or textures.
