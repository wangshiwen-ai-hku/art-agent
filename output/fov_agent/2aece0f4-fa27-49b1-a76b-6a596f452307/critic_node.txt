Modify the main body of the solid black lowercase letter 'a' to be a perfect geometric circle. The internal white negative space (the counter) must exclusively form the complete silhouette of the cat's head. Remove all internal black features currently within the white shapeâ€”the eyes, nose, mouth, and whiskers. The upper inner contour of the black circular 'a' must be reshaped to sculpt out the white space, creating the form of two distinct, sharp, triangular cat ears. The final result is a single, unified solid black shape, where its inner boundary entirely and flawlessly defines the outer silhouette of the white cat's head.
