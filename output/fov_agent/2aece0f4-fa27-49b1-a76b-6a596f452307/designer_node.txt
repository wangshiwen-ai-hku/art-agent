logo design, flat icon, minimalist, vector, negative space, black and white, clean lines, bold shapes, monochrome. A solid black, bold, geometric lowercase letter 'a' is the primary positive shape, featuring a perfect circular body and a straight vertical stem on the right. The internal negative space, the white counter inside the circular body of the 'a', is ingeniously designed to form the unmistakable silhouette of a cat's head viewed from the front. The upper boundary of this white space is not a simple curve; it is sculpted into two distinct, sharp, triangular cat ears. The inner contour of the black letter 'a's body simultaneously creates and defines the complete outer profile of the white cat's head, creating a perfect and clever fusion where the boundary is shared. The design is a masterful example of figure-ground interplay, centered on a pure white background, featuring extremely sharp edges, with absolutely no gradients, textures, or shadows.
