A minimalist black and white logo, vector art, high contrast, clean lines, isolated on a white background. Logo design, yin-yang, negative space, figure-ground reversal, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white. Two perfectly interlocking shapes forming a single, cohesive form representing war and peace. A solid black shape of a stylized, falling bomb as the positive form, pointing downwards. In the surrounding negative space, a pure white silhouette of a dove is revealed as the negative form, flying upwards. The boundary interaction is the core of the design: the shared, curved contour line simultaneously defines the right side of the black bomb's casing and the left side of the white dove's breast and neck. The sharp tip of the downward-pointing bomb perfectly forms the beak of the upward-flying dove. The fins at the top of the black bomb seamlessly become the fanned-out tail feathers of the white dove. The two forms, war and peace, are in a state of perfect, mutual balance, each giving shape to the other. Isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, clean, solid shapes, no text, no gradients.
