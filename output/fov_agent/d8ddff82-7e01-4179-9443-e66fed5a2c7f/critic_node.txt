Remove the separate white dove shape with its black outline and internal feather details. The solid black positive form is a simple, abstract silhouette of a soldier's helmet only, viewed from the side; remove the soldier's face, neck, and collar details. Reshape the lower contour of the black helmet so that it simultaneously creates the upper outline of a peace dove in the negative space. The front edge of the helmet's brim should curve down and forward to become the dove's beak. The inner, lower edge of the helmet's main body must form the smooth, curved line of the dove's head and back. The entire white dove silhouette is formed exclusively by this shared boundary with the black helmet shape, creating a single, cohesive graphic icon.
