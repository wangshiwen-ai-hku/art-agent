A minimalist black and white logo, vector art, high contrast, clean lines, isolated on a white background. Logo design, negative space, minimalist, flat icon, vector art, black and white. A solid black, abstract shape of a soldier's helmet serves as the positive form, a simple, bold silhouette viewed from the side with a distinct curved dome and brim. A white silhouette of a peace dove is revealed in the negative space as the negative form, nestled against the helmet. The crucial shared boundary is the lower contour of the black helmet, which simultaneously and flawlessly creates the upper outline of the white dove's head, beak, and elegantly curved back. The helmet's shape gives way to the dove, as if releasing it, symbolizing peace emerging from war. The entire design is a single, cohesive graphic icon, isolated on a pure white background, high contrast, clean, solid shapes, no gradients or textures.
